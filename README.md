When you wanna do a very simple bare bones C# web application that does support SSL, this project is for you.
It basically is just using the kestrel web server and some minor additions, to create something like a blog engine or however you could call that.

This is nothing for large scale, as this is supposed to be of size that can be stored in memory, for quick access.
So just for your hobby projects. 

You can duplicate it though onto different machines and have a load balancer randomly targeting each machine I guess, to scale this in a red-neck way.
